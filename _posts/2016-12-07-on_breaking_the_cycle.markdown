title:  "On Breaking The Cycle"

In the vast amounts of projects and hobbies I've sinked my hands into, I've always known myself to get stuck right around the center of the beginning stages. Even getting past this first sentence is taking a whole lot more effort than I had hoped. As much as I try to attribute this stillness to a lack of discipline or even depression on a more subtle scalle, acknowledging it and doing something about breaking the cycle requires a lot more effort than my body can handle at times.

Starting this bootcamp I was incredibly excited to finally begin my comprehensive adventure in web development. The day I began the bootcamp, I happily read forwards and backwards the topics that awaited me as I progressed down the Ruby stack. I tried to make sense of its integration with the free aspects of Learn and was happy to learn (haha) that a bunch of things that I felt I needed to expand my knowledge on as I was going the free route was patiently awaiting to be unfolded. As I progressed a little more than halfway down the "Intro to Ruby" section, I found myself staring at the computer screen for days on end without actually going through the material. 

I've seen this same pattern arise in making music on my guitar, making short films while in film school, and as I began a bunch of other courses I signed up for on Udemy, Coursera, and other online learning platforms. I don't believe that I'm lying to myself when I say I want to create things for a living since it hasn't always been like this. I've recorded albums worth of guitar melodies that I haven't had a chance to devote time to. I want to focus on improving my health through yoga and mindfulness while trying to become a better programmer. I've hacked a bunch of little programs that get me really excited about wanting to dig deeper into the seemingly infinite possibilities in programming. I've made short films that aren't exactly the greatest, but it makes me proud to know that I can collaborate with diverse people to create a short film in which we are able to create awareness on topics people normally toss under the rug.

Life isn't always as stagnant as it may appear. I feel like this may help no one but me to list everything I'm currently balancing:

1. Full-time work (in which I try to program as often as possible on my downtime)
2. Yoga (Along with regulating Scoliosis and my eating habits)
3. Programming bootcamp (yay Flatiron school!)
4. Moving into a new house with my family (which comes with a shitstorm of problems)
5. A lovely girlfriend
6. Buddhism (this has had a greater impact in my life lately)
7. Counteracting my addiction to video games (it's tough!)
8. Actively reading (to help do away with #7)
9. Playing guitar (hasn't happened in far too long)
10. Sleeping on the living room couch (and not having any room or privacy while trying to move out)
11. Making sure my dog is healthy. he is pretty old now :(
12. Finding happiness through it all.
13. Improving my financial situation (getting divorced, paying off loans, debt, etc.)

What I've been able to gather from Tibetan Buddhism is that being able to detach yourself from everything transient in nature help in acheiving enlightenment. While I know this doesn't mean to literally remove yourself from your current life retreat to a mountain in the Himalayas in order to be on the path to enlightenment, trying to see things as transient can be very confusing when you have your whole life to tend to. I feel like I'm rambling now, but what I ultimately want to do is to continue living and learning. I don't want to stay still. Maybe having this physical manifestation of all the things I need to tend to will help in some way or another, but for now, I'll look back at this post whenever I feel like I am suffocating from the inside out.
