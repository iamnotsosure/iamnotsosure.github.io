Strangely enough, I feel like software development chose me at an early age. Although I didn't realize it at the time, I always gravitated towards the creative aspects of music, and film that involved tinkering with hardware and software. I was always enthralled by the stories, worlds & art that came to life in video games, the carefully placed cameras in movies, and the seemingly infinite permutations of musical notes on a musical instrument. Although I tried going to college for both film & music, I quickly realized that I have no desire to make a carreer out of film and music. I didn't want my artistic passion to be complicated by struggling to survive.

I dropped out of film school and sat in front of my laptop for a few months thinking about what I'd like to do with my life. In the end, I decided that I wanted to be creative in some way or another, because I felt really happy doing that. It felt great to work with people on crappy film projects in school, it felt great to make a bunch of shitty metal songs with my friends. I felt like my life had meaning as I spliced away chunks of magnetic audio recording tape. I wanted to find another craft that brought that same feeling to me.

I considered moving away to a far off country to become a farmer and I considered growing pot. I considered just about every profession under the sun until I came across code.org's "Hour of Code". I tried it, and it felt refreshingly natural to me. the logic behind displaying "Hello, World!" on a local HTML site felt a distant cousin I once knew a long time ago. I began looking through just about every website's source code to try and figure out how they made their website look as cool as it did.

As I kept chipping off bits and pieces of information from the internet, I came across my local community college's page for their Computer Science major. As I skimmed through it, I noticed the amount of math and physics involved. Although I was terrified for never having cared about those subjects in high school and most of college, I bravely accepted the challenge. I had to remember basic algebra and somehow make my way past Calculus 3 and Electricity & Magnetism.

I managed to graduate two years later, but I still felt extremely incompetent as a programmer. It was nice to participate in clubs with classmates that were very excited to learn about CS and Engineering while at HCCC because it helped me become more involved in getting people involved and excited about learning, but looking back, we didn't have enough of a practical approach to actually learn programming & engineering.

I tried signing up for a bunch of free online courses, but I quickly became part of that large percentile that never finishes those kinds of courses. For better or worse, those courses have kept my curiousity hungry. That hunger lead me to keep in contact with Ashley Muller, since I knew she was doing a bunch of cool things over here! Eventually I got a chance to attend the full-time full stack web developer bootcamp, but unfortunately I could not make the financial demand for it. More recently, the community-powered bootcamp opened up and now here we are!

Before I end this wall of text, I feel like I should let myself and any potential readers know about my goals outside of getting a job as a web developer.
Through programming, I want to somehow blur the lines of fine art and programming by making art with code. I don't know exactly what i want to make, but I want to make things collaboratively with artists.

I would love to make something like [this](https://youtu.be/sbjOMualLVs)
As long as I'm making art in the long run, I'll be a happy camper.
